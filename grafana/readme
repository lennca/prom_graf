### provisioning

In order to provisioning dashboards, we'll need:

* Volume-mount exported dashboards into the directory `/etc/grafana/provisioning`
* Tell Grafana to use the provisioned dashboards by volume-mount a `dashboard.yaml` file into
the same directory `/etc/grafana/provisioning`
* !Important! If exported dashboard from Grafana that you would want to provisioning
- you'll need to replace all keys `uid` with value `${DS_PROMETHEUS}` with the 
the value `Prometheus` (defined as the key `name` in the `/datasources/promethehus.yaml`)
